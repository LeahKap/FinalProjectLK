# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I have 2 possible ideas. 
1)Making a virtual game of Otrio which is a version of Tik Tak Toe with 3 different sized circles. 
The real game can be played with up to 4 people, which I will attempt but I might end up doing 2. The 
board is the same grid as Tik Tak toe but each square has a spot for a small, medium, and large circle. 
You can get tik tac toe multiple ways; same-size circles in a row, circles in ascending/descending size 
order, or all 3 sizes in one square. 
2) Making a virtual version of cup pong, a game where you throw balls at 10 cups lined up in a pyramid formation, 
with the goal of getting your ball into each cup before the other team. For this one, I might have the person play against
the computer and allow the option to reconfigure the cups when there are a certain number of them (e.g., when there 
are 6 cups left, you can ask to put them into a pyramid configuration).

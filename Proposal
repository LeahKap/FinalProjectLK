# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
OOOtrio

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
 A version of tic tac toe where each player gets 9 same colored pieces,3 pieces of 3 different sizes. This allows a person to win in 3 ways (same size in a row, size increasing/decreasing order, all 3 sizes in one spot). (Otrio is a board game)
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I am planning on using Python Turtle to create the playing pieces and write code for the game. The players will be able to interact with the game through input questions of where they want to put which playing piece. 
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 Make a version of tic tac toe with 2 players and 3 sizes of pieces. These pieces will be able to be moved onto selected spots on the board. Hopefully, the computer will be able to detect a winning pattern and display a message. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Make a version of tic tac toe with 2 players and 3 size pieces.  These pieces will be able to be moved onto selected spots on the board. Then when a winning pattern is obtained the computer will sense it and display a message. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Make a version of tic tac toe with 2 to 4 players and 3 size pieces.  These pieces will be able to be moved onto selected spots on the board. Then when a winning pattern is obtained the computer will sense it and display a message. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to research how to make my code sense winning patterns. Meaning I will need to figure how can python turtle detect when certain parts are in certain patterns.
